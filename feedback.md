- In slides 3-7 (give or take), one thing you'll want to be careful about is making sure that the audience understands that in fact there is a social network present. This will be obvious to a networks person as soon as they see lines between the people on the slides, but it's worth making sure that you explicitly point out that these lines are meant to represent friendship or some similar social relation. Also, a probably unavoidable pitfall: as soon as someone sees a bunch of people all fencing or climbing or whatever, they are going to jump straight to SBM. That might be just fine for this talk, but make sure at some point to stress that X doesn't HAVE to encode just block membership.

- Circa slide 15 or 16, it occurs to me that perhaps introducing the network A so early might be a bit of a red herring. The point is that group membership is the mediator, but one that we don't get to observe. Instead, we get to see it in general settings only via a (noisily measured) social network. I guess the point I'm trying to make is that your illustrative example makes it seem like "interest" is something we get to see explicitly, when in fact it is latent.

- One thing that might be nice is to include a discussion of one of our actual real data experiments. Of course, this would have to come at the cost of the theory, and I think IFDS is more of a theory audience, but worth seeing if you can squeeze in a mention of either the reddit analysis or the Glasgow analysis.
